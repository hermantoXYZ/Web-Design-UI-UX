# \<br>

The `<br>` tag in HTML is used to insert a line break within text or content. It is a **self-closing** tag, meaning it does not require a closing tag.

#### **Basic Usage:**

```html
<p>This is the first line.<br>This is the second line.</p>
```

#### **Common Use Cases:**

* Breaking text into multiple lines without starting a new paragraph.
* Formatting addresses or poetry.
* Creating spacing in content without extra margins.

#### **Example â€“ Address Formatting:**

```html
<p>
    John Doe<br>
    123 Main Street<br>
    New York, NY 10001<br>
    USA
</p>
```

#### **Important Notes:**

* Avoid excessive use of `<br>` for layout purposes. Use CSS (`margin`, `padding`, `line-height`) for better control.
* `<br>` should be used **only** where a true line break is needed (e.g., addresses, poems, or user-generated content).
