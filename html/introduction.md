# Introduction

**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.

* HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it annotates text to define how it is structured and displayed by web browsers.
* It forms the building blocks of all websites and is complemented by CSS for style and JavaScript for interactivity.
