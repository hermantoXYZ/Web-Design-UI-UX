# \<b>

Make some text bold (without marking it as important):

```html
<p>This is normal text - <b>and this is bold text</b>.</p>
```

### Definition and Usage

The `<b>` tag specifies bold text without any extra importance.

The `<b>` tag in HTML is used to make text **bold** without adding extra emphasis or importance. It is different from the `<strong>` tag, which conveys semantic importance.

#### When to Use `<b>`:

* To style text for visual purposes (e.g., keywords, product names).
* When the bold text does not carry extra meaning or importance.

#### `<b>` vs. `<strong>`:

* `<b>` → Purely for styling (bold text).
* `<strong>` → Indicates **important** text for accessibility and SEO.

Example:

```html
<p>Use <b>bold</b> for styling and <strong>strong</strong> for importance.</p>
```
